This project aims to expand on James W. Loewen's work regarding "Sundown Towns" across the US.  In particular, it aims to address the [first step in confirming Sundown Towns](http://sundown.tougaloo.edu/content.php?file=sundowntowns-howto.html) by examining census data and making it available to Loewen and others as a basis for future work.
